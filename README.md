# tphome
A stupidly simple teleport home plugin for Paper Servers.

This adds a /tphome command to Paper Servers to allow users to teleport to their respawn point.  If they do not have a respawn point set, to the server spawn.


**NOTE:** This plugin only runs on Paper Servers.


**To install:**

Drop into the plugins folder and restart your server.


(_Optional_) Edit the config.yml to restrict the usage of the command.


**To use:**

Enter the `/tphome` command into chat.

Server Operators with the `minecraft.command.selector` permission (as well as Command Blocks and Functions) can supply an optional single player selector.

The command can also be used in command blocks and datapacks.

**Permissions:**

`tphome.home` - Allow user to run command when restricted.
